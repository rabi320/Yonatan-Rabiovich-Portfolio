This project predicted default of home equity loan clients using classifiction with Machine Learning models and ensembles and Deep Learning neural networks and TabNet.
The model can be used to classify potential defaulters and simplify the bank's decision making. This model has reached 92.6% accuracy on test set and 0.82 f1 score with TabNet Classifier. This model is deployed to a web app for testing parameters and then predicting the outcome.

This project predicted The prices of Diamonds using regression with Machine Learning models and ensembles.
The model can be used to estimate the worth of the diamond based on it's features and similar diamons recorded proces. This model has reached 0.986 adjusted R^2 on test set and 472 rmse with ExtraTrees Regressor. This model is deployed to a web app that takes inputs from users and estimates the diamond's price.

This project a recommedation engine is created.
The reccomendation is based on item collaborative filltering using cosine similarity. A thorough EDA is created and then a system is build using the aforementioned methods.
Finally an app is created showing the trends of anime recommendation of the top 10 scored bayesian average anime and item based recommendation for an input of anime, based on the initial type of anime format that is being analyzed.
